#####  Low performance

Style: DOS VersionVerified Purchase

Very bad laptop, not good to use photoshop on it. Graphic card only 128 Mb! It is tooooo low. Battery is very small comparatively to the laptop size. During installation of new windows, it will request a wife connection otherwise, you won’t be able to complete the installation of the new windows. The main issue in this step is, you can’t connect to the network during installation because the wife driver is not installed, so you need to connect an external usb WiFi.This laptop only suitable for internet surfing.I don’t recommend it to someone planning to suit for heavy duty.
