kg.\*\* Based on the Performance Lab Test report by Springboard Engineering on EMPA strips, comparing a normal detergent solution and bubble technology without mechanical action. Individual results may vary.\*\*\* Compared to washing in warm water. Tested in accordance with IEC 60456-2010 / 4 kg Wash Load / Super Eco Wash cold (WF80F5E5U4W) vs. Cotton 40°C without Ecobubble™ (WF0702WKU). Individual results may vary.

Maximum saving from running at 20 degrees instead of 40 degrees.\*\*\* Based on internal testing on the WW11BB944AGB model in normal usage conditions.Results: Power consumption without AI Energy Mode = 0.539 KWh.

### Great wash quality but smart features need improve

Abhisheknegi

4 months ago

I really like this washing machine as it cleans clothes very effectively and has multiple wash options.

But there are two things I didn’t like:
1\. There is no “Dry Only” option. Sometimes I just want to dry clothes for 5–10 minutes, but I can’t do it. It would be great if Samsung could add this feature through the SmartThings app.
2\. We have to be manually present to press the start button. That means I cannot start the wash cycle remotely through the SmartThings app, even though it was advertised with AI and smart features.

Yes, I recommend this product.
