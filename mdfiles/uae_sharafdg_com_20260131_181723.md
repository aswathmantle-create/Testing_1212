##### Details

## Experience immersive entertainment with the Sony 85-inch Bravia 5 Mini LED 4K HDR Android Television. Featuring advanced display technology and smart capabilities, it delivers stunning visuals and seamless connectivity for an enhanced viewing experience across various content.

**Impressive brightness, vividly beautiful colors**

Bright, beautiful, and full of life. Our TV brings rich colors and detailed contrast, delivering every frame that feels vivid and engaging, no matter what you watch.

**Striking contrast. Professional monitor core technology.**

Every moment comes to life. Similar to the backlight control core technology in our master monitors (professional monitors), XR Backlight Master Drive with a unique local dimming algorithm controls thousands of LEDs accurately for stunning contrast. This beautifully captures light and shadow with precise gradation, from subtle facial shading to bold highlights.

**Crystal clear pictures. With AI technology.**

Rediscover detail. XR Clear Image intelligently upscales your favorites to near-4K, adjusting processing based on the original content’s quality. This ensures natural textures and details shine through, while dynamic frame analysis and zone division minimize noise.

**Over a billion vivid, real-world colors**

See the world’s colors with all the vibrance of real life. Our XR Triluminos Pro reproduces over a billion of them with the subtle differences from saturation and hue that enables natural shades in every detail.

**Even fast-moving action stays smooth, bright and clear**

Forget about blur. XR Motion Clarity analyzes movement across several frames and precisely synchronizes the backlight with on-screen motion so you see clear, bright images, however fast the action.

**Unmatched realism with XR Processor and AI technology**

Powered for precision. Our XR Processor features an AI scene recognition system that now detects and analyzes with even greater accuracy, optimizing the picture for deeper realism. With improved detection, every scene is finely tuned for a more lifelike viewing experience.

**From the studio to your screen**

Dive into cinema-like visuals at home. Our home entertainment picture quality expertise helps us faithfully reproduce the creator’s vision with Studio Calibrated modes developed through collaboration with Sony and the world’s top streaming services.

**Bring the cinematic experience home, enjoy movies included with BRAVIA**

A huge number of movies are waiting for you. With BRAVIA technology, Pure Stream and IMAX Enhanced, everything you watch is delivered with stunning visuals and expressive sound quality.

**SONY PICTURES CORE brings the cinematic experience home**

This is how you were meant to enjoy movies. SONY PICTURES CORE Calibrated Mode has been jointly developed by our TV engineers and Sony Pictures specialists to bring studio-quality picture mastering to your living room.

**Watch Netflix in studio quality, automatically optimized**

See Netflix in a whole new light. Our Netflix Adaptive Calibrated Mode, designed by Sony and Netflix, brings studio-quality mastering home with brightness automatically adjusted to your ambient room conditions.

**Sony and Prime Video bring the movie theater experience to your home**

See movies, shows, and even live sports the way the filmmakers and broadcasters intended. With Prime Video Calibrated Mode, picture settings are auto calibrated to what you’re watching including live sports for studio-quality Prime Video at home.

**Immersive movie experience**

Experience truly unforgettable movies at home. Our TV supports the rigorous standards of IMAX Enhanced, DTS:X, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos for an unbelievably atmospheric and immersive viewing experience.

**IMAX Enhanced sound with DTS:X**

You can enjoy a truly cinematic experience with select Disney+ titles on BRAVIA and BRAVIA Theater, powered by IMAX Enhanced technology.

**Cinematic sound—hear it all**

Sit back and feel the sound transform your space. With two powerful side-mounted speakers reproducing clear sound from the screen, everyone is drawn into a movie night they won’t forget.

**Theater-like sound, perfectly matching pictures**

Hear sound from exactly the right place. Not from beneath the screen but seemingly straight from the screen itself. With Acoustic Multi-Audio, what you see and what you hear are perfectly matched.

**Uniquely shaped for clearer sound and deeper bass**

Clarity is crucial. Unlike conventional TV speakers where sound waves can become blurred, our X-Balanced Speaker with its uniquely shaped diaphragm reduces distortion for improved sound resolution.

**Crystal clear voice. With AI technology.**

No more muffled voices. Our Voice Zoom 3 recognizes human dialogue through AI machine learning and amplifies or reduces its volume so even small dialogue sounds loud and clear. Works with our home theater products too.

**Intelligent processing upscales ordinary stereo sound to extraordinary 3D surround.**

Be immersed. Our 3D Surround Upscaling creates virtual surround from above and the sides using just the TV speakers. Even 2ch and 5.1ch audio is upscaled to immersive 5.1.2ch sound. Moreover, Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support provides unforgettable spatial sound.

**With BRAVIA Theater, home becomes cinema**

Fill every corner of your room with soul-stirring cinematic sound. Pairing BRAVIA with BRAVIA Theater brings the emotion and excitement of the movie theater, home, an unmatched audio-visual experience.

**Sound precisely matches what’s on screen**

Sound is calibrated as one integrated speaker system. Acoustic Center Sync enables our home theater equipment to use BRAVIA as a center speaker so that sound comes from the screen rather than just the soundbar.

**Sony \| BRAVIA Connect app**

Control BRAVIA and BRAVIA Theater from your smartphone. With the BRAVIA Connect app, you can adjust volume and settings and even check your set up without using the remote or on screen menu.

**Control your BRAVIA Theater effortlessly**

Easily control features such as sound field and volume using just the TV remote. With an integrated UI, soundbar sound settings automatically appear on the BRAVIA Quick Settings menu.

**HDMI connection. Easier for everyone.**

Never again have trouble connecting your soundbar and TV via HDMI. Tactile dots on the ARC/ACS terminal makes linking up easier for everyone.

**Ready for 360 Spatial Sound Personalizer**

Tailor your Dolby Atmos and DTS:X experience by combining our wearable speaker or BRAVIA Theater U with BRAVIA for spatial surround. Works with some Sony Headphones too.

**Single view, simultaneous sound**

Our TV with simultaneous sound output lets you listen to a show on your headphones while your partner listens to the same show through the TV speakers. You can also change the volume using Bluetooth devices separately. Using Sony’s headphone, you can smoothly switch Bluetooth connection from other devices.

**Harmonic Presence. Blends in naturally.**

Everything in harmony. Our new TV designs grace your living space with shapes, materials, colors and surface treatments that blend beautifully with interior décor, walls and home theater products.

**One Slate. Sleek simplicity from everywhere.**

Totally unified. Our One Slate concept fuses screen and bezel into a single slate, minimizing distractions and maximizing your experience.

**Flush Surface. Drawing you in.**

Form and function, beautifully combined. Our unique Flush Surface design gives the TV a clean, contemporary look. This is beauty that doesn’t get in the way of your viewing.

**Perfectly integrates TV and soundbar, almost no stand visible**

Cleverly concealed. Our Underlay Stand is a thin, flat steel plate designed with a metallic hairline finish. Stack BRAVIA Theater on top of the stand and it virtually disappears.

**2-way stand—adaptable and versatile**

Suits your space. Our 2-way stand gives you the choice of a compact inside position for smaller shelves or a soundbar-friendly setup—no need to compromise on style.

**Everything you stream. All on one screen.**

Browse 700,000+ movies and TV episodes from across your streaming services, all in one place and organized into topics and genres based on what interests you.

**Over 10,000 apps and games, straight to your TV**

Turn on and tune in, all at once. With dedicated buttons for your go-to apps, you can skip the TV warm-up and dive right into the action.

**Google Cast**

Stream from your device. Easily cast movies, shows, photos, and more from your phone or tablet, right to your TV.

**Compatible with Apple AirPlay 2**

Stream effortlessly to your TV from your iPhone, iPad or Mac. Watch movies from apps or Safari. Share photos with friends in the room.

**Do more on your TV with your voice with Google Assistant**

Your TV is more helpful than ever. Ask Google Assistant to find movies, stream apps, play music and control the TV with your voice. Get answers, adjust room temperature and lighting, even check the front door. Press the Google Assistant button on the remote to get started.

**Connect with your Alexa**

Connect your Alexa enabled devices for seamless hands-free control of BRAVIA. With Alexa, you can power up your TV, change channels, control volume and more.

**More intuitive. Modern interface.**

Finding your way around just got easier. We’ve redesigned our user interface for smoother operation so you can effortlessly check inputs and view settings.

**Best seat. Anywhere. Anytime.**

Wherever you are, everything’s perfect. Detecting your position, BRAVIA Cam adjusts brightness, sound balance and volume so your experience is optimized to where you’re sitting.

**Proximity Alert**

Keep your kids a step back. Proximity Alert allows you to set a recommended viewing distance for your child and alerts them if they get too close to the TV.

**A handy way to control your TV**

As easy as a flick of the fingers. Gesture Control enables you to change channels, adjust volume and more using simple gestures, no remote required.

**Camera covered, privacy protected**

One swipe protects your privacy. Simply use the switch on top of BRAVIA Cam to close the camera cover. Attaching and detaching BRAVIA Cam is so easy.

**Video calling on a bigger screen**

Catch up with friends and family on a bigger screen when you pair your TV with BRAVIA Cam

**TV for the whole family**

With kids profiles, kids get their very own Google TV experience — a space that’s just for them, with their own apps and entertainment. Kids can pick from a selection of playful avatars and themes, and parents can restrict what streaming services are shown, limit watching time, and set a bedtime.

**Stay tuned. Stay calm.**

See everything in a more comfortable light for peace of mind. Calm picture setting is a picture quality mode that lowers brightness and uses softer colors and contrast.

**Easy to clean and use. Made with recycled plastic.**

Controls everything. Our compact remote uses approximately 79.7% recycled plastic. Yet it’s easy to clean with a flush surface and polyurethane coating, and controls your connected devices.

**Perfect for PlayStation 5**

Be right at the heart of the action with BRAVIA. Awe-inspiring scenes, atmospheric sound and exclusive features bring your go-to games to life like never before.

**Auto HDR Tone Mapping**

Auto HDR Tone Mapping instantly optimizes HDR settings during your PS5 and PS5 Pro console initial setup. Even in dark shadow and bright highlights, you’ll see fine details and true colors.

**Auto Genre Picture Mode**

BRAVIA automatically switches into Game Mode with PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles to minimize lag and maximize responsiveness. It switches back to Standard Mode when watching movies for more expressive scenes.

**Stream PlayStation games to your BRAVIA**

Control your PlayStation remotely wherever you have a compatible BRAVIA connected to the internet. The PS Remote Play app lets you control your PS5, PS5 Pro or PS4 console from another room or location like a friend’s house.

**All your gaming essentials in one place**

Everything’s so easy with Game Menu 2. Check your status, fine tune settings and access assist functions from one place. You can even search for YouTube videos and switch to Gaming multi view on YouTube in an instant.

**Gaming multi view on YouTube, a game-changer**

Imagine being able to play a game on one side of your screen while watching a YouTube walkthrough video on the other. Gaming multi view on YouTube lets you do just that, no extra display required.

**Dolby Vision support brings gaming to life**

This is how your game world should be. Incredibly vibrant colors, lifelike contrast in light and dark, intense brightness. With Dolby Vision, gaming reaches a whole new level of depth and realism.

**Various features in HDMI 2.1**

With Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM), our TVs give you smooth and clear movement for responsive gameplay.
